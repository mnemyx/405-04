Assignment #4 - Recursive Raytracing


DESCRIPTION
Expands the ray tracer from program #3 by adding reflections and scene control.

For scene control, it reads in a .txt file (included in the zip is 
originalscene.txt for the original scene assigned in the project and a
scene.txt that I played with.)  Format for camera control is the same as previous.  
For lights and sphere, almost the same thing but the amount of spheres and lights must 
be included, then the details of each.  See the two .txt files for an idea.
